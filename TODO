Part 0: Change version v14 to v8
Part 6: Section 3 needs to be a Heart.
Part 7: Use Palpable Juice Stream Object as the foundation.
Part 8: Use Tiny Juice Stream as the foundation. Achieve this with an empty timing point. Tiny Juice Streams are used to move the player, where the Fruit always stays in place.
Part 9: Make first half stroke banana art and second half filled banana art.
Part 10: Use the catchers platter for cool visuals. At the moment this isn't possible, since all objects are purely 100% RNG; not seeded-RNG like how catch maps work, but RNG related to the users time.
